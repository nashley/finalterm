# Final Term default terminal commands
#
# Entries take the form
#   NAME = COMMAND; COMMAND; ...
# NAME will be prefixed with "," automatically.
# The commands on the right hand side are executed sequentially.
# Command line argument $i is substituted for the placeholder %i.
#
# NOTE: The CLEAR_SHELL_COMMAND, SET_SHELL_COMMAND and RUN_SHELL_COMMAND
#       commands will not work as expected when used here, since they
#       are executed immediately, i.e. before the shell prompt is shown.
